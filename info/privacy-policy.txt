We the developers at SG Apps believe that we should keep privacy as a priority in all our services. We always try our best to encrypt data with multiple algorithms and secure it before we store it on on our cloud/local databases. Besides this, we track user sessions using tools like Microsoft Clarity. While using such tools, we ensure that sensitive content and text is masked and hidden in the tracking data. We never share this data with anyone and is only reviewed by our team for ensuring our app functions properly for everyone, for maintaining proper ads and are not too harsh and do not contain any sort of malware. (if present) and for finding security vulnerabilities. We do not display any kind of ads on our site due to which our user's privacy is maintained from ad corporations. Besides this, we may use other analytics tools too like Google Analytics, Google Search Console, etc. to have a better statistical data of our websites/apps. To ensure better transparency, we try our best to keep our apps open source on platforms like Github (@sanchogodinhoapps) so that anyone can audit the source code, directly report vulnerabilities, contribute new features/repair bugs, open pull requests, report issues, etc. WE NEVER SHARE USER'S PERSONAL DATA FROM OUR DATABASE WITHOUT THE USER'S CONSENT AND/OR AS PER OUR TERMS OF THAT SPECIFIC WEBSITE/APP. To ensure privacy with the database, we always ensure that our database's keys are stored in a .env file which cannot be accessed by the users in the source code. WE TRY OUR BEST TO MAKE OUR APPS SECURE AND TAKE EVERY SECURITY MEASURE TO PROTECT YOUR DATA AT SG APPS.
